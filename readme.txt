Testimonials Creator is a WordPress plugin with main purpose of building awesome testimonial showcase on your website. The plugin is packed with flexible testimonial builder, rating submission form, various design layouts and absolute freedom on styling. It’s possible to craft almost any design you can imagine. It has a shortcode generator.

You can display the entries in 2 different ways:

  *  Grid - The entries will display in a grid with a specified number of columns and with the elements aligned depending on your settings. Other options include image shape and effects and different themes.

  *  Slider - The entries will display in a slider, with the settings you defined. You’ll be able to control the transition effect, number of entries to display in each slide, and what type of controls. This is a very simple WordPress solution to display testimonials in a slider.

It couldn’t be more easy to generate the necessary code to display the entries. Just go to the Shortcode generator, choose the settings you want and the shortcode and the php function that you can use will be generated and ready to copy and paste where you want! Shortcodes are to be used in posts, pages and widgets.
