Testimonials Creator is a WordPress plugin with main purpose of building awesome testimonial showcase on your website. The plugin is packed with flexible testimonial builder, rating submission form, various design layouts and absolute freedom on styling. It’s possible to craft almost any design you can imagine.

You can display the entries in 2 different ways:

Slider – The entries will display in a slider, with the settings you defined. You’ll be able to control the transition effect, number of entries to display in each slide, and what type of controls. This is a very simple WordPress solution to display testimonials in a slider.

It couldn’t be more easy to generate the necessary code to display the entries.
